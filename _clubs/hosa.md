_Our mission is to enable secondary students to become leaders in the healthcare industry by enabling future health professionals to acquire knowledge, skills training and leadership development through competition. Each year we prepare boys to compete at Canada’s largest health science competition for secondary and post-secondary students._

We meet on Brightspace during community time (Club B time block).
We’re always welcoming new members throughout the year – if you’re interested in joining
