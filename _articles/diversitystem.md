### Introduction - STEM Workforce

In recent years, a gap has slowly begun to develop in the STEM field of work and study, a gap that displays the underrepresentation of racialized communities as well as those who are not male. In particular, the number of Black and Hispanic workers has diminished the most. According to the Nationals Science Foundation (NSF), 89% of the STEM workforce is white and 72% are male while in the general workforce, 78% is white and 53% is male.


The Pew Research Center for Science and Society came to a similar conclusion. According to their research on the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), they discovered that the Black community has 11% of jobs in the overall American workforce, yet only 9% in the American STEM workforce. The same rings true for the Hispanic workforce as they hold 17% of the total jobs in the American workforce but only 8% in the STEM workforce.

### Diversity In STEM Education


In comparison to their population share, black and Hispanic adults are underrepresented among STEM college graduates, with a smaller share receiving degrees in STEM fields than in other degree programmes.


As of 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, black students received 7% of STEM bachelor's degrees, which is lower than their share of all bachelor's degrees (10%) or their share of the adult population (12%).  In 2018, the percentage of Hispanic college graduates with a STEM degree (12%) remained lower than that of all college graduates (15%).


As compared to their share of all college graduates in 2018, Asian and White students continue to be overrepresented among STEM college graduates. Other racial groups, such as Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and people who identify with two or more racial groups, are receiving bachelor's degrees in STEM in about the same proportion as all degree recipients.


Black and Hispanic adults, especially those with Ph.D.s or other research doctorates, are also underrepresented in STEM fields. In the fields of math, physical sciences, and engineering, Black and Hispanic adults have the lowest representation.

### Conclusion

Obviously, the STEM workforce is not an entirely equitable group. Nonetheless, recent data and information shows that improvements are being made, and the chasm is being bridged so that all races and communities can be equitably recognized and represented in the STEM workforce.
