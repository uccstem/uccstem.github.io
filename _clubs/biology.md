_Expanding our knowledge on biology through discussion, experimentation in labs and engagement with contests such as the Canadian Biology Olympiad and British Biology Olympiad._

Hello, thank you for checking out the UCC Biology club! Over the course of the year, we do interest biology-focused experiments and lead discussions on real-world biological issues. In addition, we participate in the following contests to grow our knowledge in the field and learn to apply what we learned in the classroom in an unfamiliar setting:

- [National Biology Competition (Canada)](https://www.biocomp.utoronto.ca/)
- [British Biology Olympiad](https://ukbiologycompetitions.org/british-biology-olympiad/)
- [The Brain Bee](https://brainbee.ca/)

To check out our resources and club files, view our [shared google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K5Yl-KF-yRJ69_eLvlIcVhskzxw1fjun?usp=sharing).

Please reach out to [Jayson Tian](mailto:jayson.tian@ucc.on.ca) if you are interested in joining the club and participating in events / competitions!
