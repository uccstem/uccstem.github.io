An annual opportunity for students to test their skills in Biology, UCC is hosting its first BBO competition this year virtually. The contest tests students in a variety of fields:
- Cellular biology
- Biochemistry
- Evolution and Diversity
- Physiology
- Plants
- Ecology

New this year, we're offering the opportunity to write the British Biology Olympiad contest; this is an online biology contest, consisting of two contest papers completed individually. It is completely voluntary.

The contest material is aimed at the Y12 equivalent level of the British high school system, but everyone is welcome to give it a try. For anyone interested, it will be held on Mon Mar 15 at 3:30 in Room 325.
