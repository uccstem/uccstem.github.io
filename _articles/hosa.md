It’s easy to think of STEM when discussing the disciplines that improve our everyday lives. Over the past couple of decades, scientific and technological advancements have revolutionized almost every corner of our lives. 

In the UCC community, STEM can be found in our classrooms, science labs, and clubs. From robotics to biology, the college offers an absurd number of opportunities to engage in exploration and innovation with the help of faculty. HOSA is one of those communities that I’ve had the pleasure of participating in.

As a new member in Year 8, STEM and HOSA were confusing and daunting subjects. I could hardly mask my surprise when I first glimpsed the gargantuan review textbooks and Quizlets our club head had procured. Prior to that, I was taking General Science as a Y8, not Biology. Regretfully, I dropped out that year, convinced that my lack of knowledge was too great to overcome over the course of a year. 

However, in Y9, I realized that HOSA presented a unique opportunity. It was and still is the only club exclusively dedicated to preparing high school students for careers in science and medicine. As someone interested in pursuing medicine, the exposure HOSA offered was invaluable. As I selected Medical Terminology as my competitive event, I resigned myself to the seven-hundred word phonebook-esque textbook that HOSA had designated as a measly reference text.

My lack of familiarity with the content and competitive aspect was disheartening at first, but with the help of my fellow club members I was able to settle in and learn the ins and outs of the club. Now in my 3rd year, I’m proud to have progressed to a leadership position. Along the way, I’ve learned that it never was about the hours of studying or my knowledge of biology; it was about creating a community focused on a common goal: improving the lives of others through service in the healthcare field. Outsiders to STEM often envision the eccentric lone scientific genius (Morty) who bury themselves in their books and labs. For me, HOSA has done quite the opposite. The brotherhood I gained by studying alongside my classmates and participating in competitions as a team was far more memorable than the hundreds of terms I had to memorize. 

To those considering joining a new club or STEM activity but are worried about their comprehension of the subject, I strongly encourage them to take a leap of faith. Clubs don’t exist solely to educate or provide opportunities for competition. They offer an individual opportunity for everyone to step outside their comfort zone and connect with peers outside of the classroom. UCC prides itself on facilities and faculty expertise and we’re exceptionally privileged to have access to them. As for myself, I will never forget the enjoyable, but difficult times I’ve spent learning how to tape athletic injuries in the Sports Injury Clinic (shoutout to Ms. Pridmore!). 

As a closing note, I’ll end with a cliché. Follow your dreams and even if they don’t turn out the way you expected them to, know that the outlandish knowledge you gained; the bonds you formed; and the experiences you made were worth every minute. At the very least, you’ll be able to use your new HOSA pizzazz and call it a “synchronous diaphragmatic flutter”.
